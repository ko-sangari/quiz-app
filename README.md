## â­• Before you begin
Before you begin, please follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named `secret`.
2. Move the `.env.template` file which is in the root directory into the `secret` folder.
3. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
4. Update the variables in the `.env` file according to your local environment.

Additionally, make sure you have another `.env` file named `.env.docker`, which should contain Docker-related variables.


## â­• How to Run the Project
Navigate to the root of the project. <br>
To build the image from the Dockerfile, run:
```commandline
docker compose up --build -d
```

<br>Or, there's a `Makefile` for your convenience, so just run: (Check other commands too!)
```commandline
make run
```

<br>Or, If you want to run the project locally, you need to have `poetry` installed first.
```commandline
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

<br>Now, you can check the Swagger URL for API documentation.
```commandline
http://localhost:8000/docs
```


## â­• How to run tests
Run _pytest_ command to run the tests separately.<br>
```commandline
make tests
```

<br>And, what about Test Coverage?
```commandline
make coverage

# Name                            Stmts   Miss  Cover
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Test Coverage TOTAL              365     11    97%
```

<br>This project has been thoroughly checked with `mypy` for type consistency, and it currently passes all mypy checks without any issues.
```commandline
make mypy
```

## â­• Final step
```commandline
make coffee
```
#### Be Happy Even if Things Arenâ€™t Perfect Now. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
#### Enjoy your coffee! â˜•
